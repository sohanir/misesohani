# MiseSohani

MiseSohani is my first github pages. I am going to try and use AMP for this one. This will be my blog, so here where I'll share my thoughts, ideas and updates.

# About me

I am Sohani Rao, a software engineer working at Google. I love coding, but I am also the creative kind. I'm currently looking for avenues to combine the two. Will GitHub pages be my answer?

You can find my linked in profile [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sohanirao) but I'm not *really* on social media otherwise.

### License and credits

I can't take credit for this. I downloaded the template from  [amp.dev](https://amp.dev/documentation/templates/simple_blog/?format=websites). I am therefore using whatever license they shared and my content, ofcourse, is mine.
